This book is about how to work smart to avoid unnecessary work. Algorithmic thinking is about identifying the most efficient steps to solve a seemingly complex problem without detouring. It is a necessary skill for future jobs.

Through a magical lens, CalliLens, you will observe abstraction and recognize patterns in the Land of Apple Pi. The authors, along with Python, transform into the main characters, the BestFour. They will accompany you through each challenge, naturally come up with the solution steps, and master algorithmic thinking without you forcefully knowing it. 

The authors have been teaching CS and USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) classes since 2016 and formed their unique approach to engaging with both visual learners and reading/writing learners. They identified a set of fundamental algorithms after pre-work analyzing the USACO questions and CS job interviews. The rigid concepts like Fibonacci, graph, recursion, queue, stack, Greedy, Dynamic Programming, Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS are expressed in visualizations, graphs, miniature poems, and fun facts. 

Oh, if coding is coffee, the flowchart will be the coffee mate. You will also receive a good taste of “coffee” and “coffee mate” from this book. 
Both children and adults are welcome to the adventure. The only prerequisite is to keep an open mind and open eyes. If you don’t know coding yet, flowcharts are your friendly starting point. What? Some of you say that you want to dive into coding? Alright, Python code and Pygames are a bonus for you to craft your programming skills.
