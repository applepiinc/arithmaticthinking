This repository contains some sample content from the book to be published on Amazon in Feb/March, 2021. This book is designed to introduce the essential framework that computer science, math and even our lives are built upon: algorithmic thinking. In simple terms, Algorithms are sequence of steps to solve a category of problems. In this book, we will grant you a magic lens called CalliLens. Wearing this lens, you will see a crystal clear world - a world where complex problems have clear outlines and patterns, and their solution steps jump out in front of you. 

We invite you to read Prologue first. It provides you the context, the characters design, the algorithms covered and the flow. Welcome to our adventure!
